    ===Technical Overview===
    ((This small [/demo/godot/raytracing.html][demo project] exploring stylized raytracing in the open source [http://godotengine.org][Godot] engine was inspired by the game [http://mirrordropgame.com][Mirror Drop] and made over three days as a fun personal project.))
    
    The system consists of:
    '''
    -- A **raytracing shader** that renders all objects in the scene
    -- A **scene manager script** that maintains a list of all active spheres and handles encoding all material and transform data into a single texture that is sent to the display shader
    -- A **sphere script** that contains an object's radius, colors, and material (emissive and reflectance values) and registers the object with the scene manager on creation and deletion
    -- A **camera script** that takes the scene texture and feeds it to the material on one or more `CanvasItem` nodes, as well as the camera's transform information
    '''

    Since spheres are currently the only supported shape, the scene rendering shader is fairly simple:
    '''
    -- Get the world-space origin and direction of the viewing ray using the fragment's `SCREEN_UV` and provided camera information
    -- Decode object transformation values from the scene texture
    -- Inverse transform the ray origin and direction for each object, test intersection, and re-transform the local hit position and normal
    -- Repeat with the hit position as the new origin and reflect the view direction by the hit normal
    -- Use normals, colors, and reflectance in a simple shading calculation at each step (up to a fixed number of bounces)
    '''
    
    ((One nice thing about this setup is that all transformations of geometry are driven by standard `Spatial` nodes (the default 3D object in Godot).))

    ((In the demo, the slider in the top left actually just adjusts the transparency of a 2D `CanvasItem` node that is the 'viewport' into the raytraced scene.
    Underneath is the output of a standard 3D camera showing what the scene looks like internally, using `MeshInstance` nodes.))
    
    ((As such, the source spatial nodes can be messed with just like in a normal game.
    For example the two smaller spheres in the demo are `RigidBody` nodes and can be clicked on or run into to bump them around.))
    
    ((__Physics, animation, etc. run exactly the same as always, and the resulting transformations are encoded into the scene texture which is in turn passed to the display shader.__))
    
    ((As with Mirror Drop, the primary limitation here is having a limited set of primitive shapes to work with, so no complex models, rigs, etc. as each shape has to be mathematically defined in the display shader.
    However, as evidenced by that game's 2019 IGF win in the visual art category, you can still get beautiful results for a __minimal__ aesthetic using only simple shapes and a good choice of colors.))
    
    ((As for future plans with this demo, I'll probably release the current version's source project once I can clean it up a little bit and document everything.
    I don't have any commercial asperations for the project as is (especially since it's aiming to recreate Mirror Drop), but I hope it can serve as a learning tool for others looking to get into graphics programming, both in Godot and more generally.))
    
    ((That said, I do have some exciting ideas for further research and development that could __potentially__ lead to an interesting game concept.))

    ((Don't forget to check out the [/demo/godot/raytracing.html][in-browser demo] if you want to play around with the system yourself! You can adjust the maximum number of bounces, as well as see various debug visualizations of the scene.))
