    Made in 48 hours for the 2018 Global Game Jam, **Command Line** is a drone management and resource collection 
    game centered around writing programs that are broadcast from communication hubs to the fleets in their command. 

    Due to the brevity of the jam, some gameplay elements were designed but never implemented, however the final 
    product showcases many of the core systems and could easily serve as a basis for future development.
