    **Hyperspace Drifter** is a classic vertically-scrolling shoot 'em, as well as my first project using the open-source Godot game engine.
    With health as your only resource you must balance offensive capabilities, time manipulation, and the ability to construct drones all while avoiding a constant barrage of enemies.
