    During late 2018 I assisted with technical art and polish for a capstone project prototype in Indiana University's Game Design Program titled **OddestSea**.
    The main focus of my work was establishing an in-engine art style following the general art direction set by the team, as well as creating a unified GPU-accelerated framework for the game's water visuals and interaction with objects.
    
    I also provided additional graphical resources for a game pitch presentation, presented at the IU Game Design Department's __Shark Tank__ event.
