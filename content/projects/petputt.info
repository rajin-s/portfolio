    **Pet Putt** is a minigolf puzzle-adventure with adorable animal friends through spherical worlds.
    The game started as a small experimental prototype, and has since grown into a full-scale independent production.

    Made using a customized fork of the open-source Godot game engine, **Pet Putt**'s award-winning visuals
    leverage a variety of shader and procedural geometry effects to produce a distinct visual style while keeping
    asset production manageable for a one-person team.

    The game's spherical courses and interaction systems have been met with a glowing reception when it was shown
    for the first time at Indy PopCon 2019, and subsequently when it was selected for the Indy Indies 2019 Winter Showcase.

    In addition to the main game, **Pet Putt Planets!** is a course-building card game being design and developed by
    [Adam Stichter](http://twitter.com/ajstichter) and myself.
