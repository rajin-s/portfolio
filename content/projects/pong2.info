    Created in the Gamedev@IU Design+Prototype Lab, **Pong 2** is a new take on an old classic, featuring a radial playfield and rhythm-based competition with a single shared controller.

    The game was shown at Indy PopCon 2019, where it attracted numerous players and was met with positive, sometimes confused, reactions all around.
    The build showcased at PopCon is currently available for all supporters of my [Patreon page!](https://patreon.com/rajin)
