    **Slug Slasher** is an action platformer all about saving the world from an onslaught of giant, evil slugs.
    My first collaborative project, it started its life as a small extracurricular endeavor, and grew into a years long learning experience.
    During development, the game was met with very positive responses at events such as Indy PopCon, the Midwest Gaming Classic, and PixelPop Festival.
    
    As a part of the game's core three-person team, I was responsible for the production of almost all final in-game content, including code, character/environment art, VFX, and sound effects.
    Additionally, I have been the team's primary manager, coordinating development, business affairs, and marketing, 
    and have been the primary point of contact for working with an independent composer.
