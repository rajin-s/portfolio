    **The Astro Parcel Service** is the master's thesis project of Emma Rausch in Indiana University's Game Design and Production program. I was contracted to provide concept art and promotional illustrations over the
    summer of 2019, creating a cohesive artistic style for the project, designing characters, props, and environments, and iterating on designs based on team feedback.

    Additionally, I created in-engine mockups to help with material stylization, visual effects, and postprocessing.
