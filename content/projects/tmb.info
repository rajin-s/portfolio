    **Too Many Bears**, a game about battling an invasion of mech-piloting cats with your ever-growing supply of 
    explosive bears, was my entry to the 40th Ludum Dare game jam, and was made completely solo in just three days. 
    My first ever submission to a public, multiple-day-long jam, the game was very well received, placing 45th 
    among over a thousand 72-hour entrants with an outstanding 16th place in graphics.
