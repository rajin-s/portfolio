oneline   : Open-source Unity submodules with extensible APIs and extensive documentation
shortrole : Solo

description : {
    !format
    Started in late 2018, this collection of open source script packages for Unity is aimed at creating a set of
    unified, extensible frameworks ranging from basic data structures to 2D cameras to 3D level editing tools.
    Each **UModule** can be integrated into git-based Unity projects as a submodule without external dependencies
    outside the whole set of modules.
    
    Currently released/in development modules include data structure extensions, 2D camera extensions, and flexible scripting syntax definition API for tools and prototypes.
