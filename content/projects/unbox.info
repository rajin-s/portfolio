    **Unbox** is a prototype 2D platformer where the level is split into various windows.
    Overlapping windows changes the terrain in new and interesting ways, enabling puzzle solving and interactions not
    possible in traditional sidescrollers.
    
    Created in two weeks for the prompt "Outside the box," the prototype doesn't feature much gameplay, but does include
    many of the systems needed to start making levels and puzzles.
