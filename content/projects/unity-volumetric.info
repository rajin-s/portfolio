oneline   : Raymarched rendering of sparse volumes and tools for authoring procedural 3D textures

    During early 2019, I did a variety of explorations into rendering volumetric data using Unity.
    The first project includes an editor tool to author complex volume textures in real-time by blending layers of different noise types produced by HLSL compute shaders.

    Using this tool, I created a demo scene using an approach to rendering clouds based on the work presented by Andrew Schneider and Nathan Vos for the game Horizon Zero Dawn.

    A follow-up project consisted of converting around two terabytes of astronomic data from the European Space Agency's GAIA mission into a usable volume texture,
    then producing an interactive visualization using a basic raymarched density accumulation technique.
