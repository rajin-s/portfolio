		In addition to [http://rajinshankar.com][this site], I have made public-facing websites mainly for
		personal or organizational use, including [http://gdiu.org][Gamedev@IU], Hoosier Games (now inactive), 
		[http://slugslasher.com][Slug Slasher], and assisted with web design for [http://tutemic.com/shmup][Tutemic].
		
		Many of these sites use a custom JavaScript toolset to dynamically load content into static HTML pages, including
		this text right here!

		I have also served as the Web &amp; Digital Design Specialist at the IU Jacobs School of Music Office of Marketing
		&amp; Publicity from 2016&ndash;2017.
