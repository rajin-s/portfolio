                <!--Still in development and marking my first foray into collaborative game development, Slug Slasher,
                a sidescrolling action-platformer, is poised to release during the first quarter of 2018! Working
                as the team's lead programmer I've been in charge of designing and implementing core game architecture,
                such as dynamic platformer physics, player movement and combat abilities, a finite state machine driven
                enemy AI system, as well as tools to aid in the game's development, all on top of the framework provided
                by the Unity game engine. Working alongside the team's two designers I've also been in charge of
                implementing unique behaviors for enemies, bosses, and environmental props. <br /><br />
                Additionally, as the game's lead artist I have set up workflows for creation of map objects, map assets,
                and eventually levels, developing a recognizable pixel-art style that suits the game's whimsical feel
                and conveys vital information to the player. I've created and animated countless enemies, effects,
                characters, backgrounds, tilesets, and tilemaps using software such as Photoshop, Illustrator,
                Graphics Gale, and Tiled Map Editor, as well as promotional materials for both print and digital media.-->
