                <em>role: solo developer</em><br /><br />
                Created during a self-imposed weekend game jam, <strong>Vect0r Space</strong> was originally designed as a vehicle for teaching
                basic game programming concepts. Following positive initial reactions, the game will likely see further development during the first half of next year.

                <!--Vect0r Space was created during a self-imposed game jam on a Sunday night in October of 2017. Originally created as vehicle for
                teaching basic game programming concepts, the prototype now sits ready to be imagined as a full game. One of the most imporant
                qualities of the project is simplicity. Artistic simplicity is derived from having basic colored geometric shapes as the only core
                visual elements and simplicity in gameplay is achieved by having only two core mechanics which are explored through the creation of
                increasingly larger and more complex enemies and environments.<br /><br />
                Future plans for the game include the design and implementation of various enemies and environments as well as the creation of a manageable
                pipline for these elements' production. It will likely be used further as a teaching tool and released along with a series of short tutorials
                covering the development of some of its core design elements.-->
