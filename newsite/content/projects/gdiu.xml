    **Gamedev@IU** is a student-run game development organization at Indiana University Bloomington.
    It aims to create an active community centered around the broad field of game design/development, promoting collaboration and independent skill development through a wide variety of activities and opportunities.
    
    I currently serve as the organization's Vice President of Programs, having drafted its original design and led its establishment as a formal student organization.
    In this role I coordinate a number of special interest groups, organize and run workshops and other events, and collaborate with the rest of the leadership team to ensure everything is running smoothly.
    
    Additionally, I am in charge of the GD@IU Design/Prototype Lab, a space in which members are encouraged to experiment with unconventional design ideas and practice their development skills with frequent 2-week long projects.
