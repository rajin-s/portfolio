    **Slug Slasher** is an action platformer all about saving the world from an onslaught of giant, evil slugs.
    Currently in development, the project started its life as a small extracurricular endeavor, and is now planned to release on major platforms before the end of the year!
    
    With every facet of its design geared towards creating a fun, exciting experience for players of all ages and skill levels, 
    the game has been met with a very positive response at showcase events such as Indy PopCon, the Midwest Gaming Classic, and PixelPop Festival.
    
    As a part of the game's core three-person team, I have been responsible for the production of almost all final in-game content including character art, environmental art, code, and sound effects.
    Additionally, I have been the team's primary manager, coordinating development, business affairs, and marketing.
